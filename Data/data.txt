+ i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied. 
+ i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality.  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds.  
+ definetely a great camera. proven canon built quality and lens. feels solid in hand.rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros.  
+ a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality.  
+ bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices.  
+ i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the 
flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like.  
+ overall i 'm happy with my toy. 
+ in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera.  
+ with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet. and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image.  
+ i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3.  do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed.  
+ i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied.  
+ the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds.  
+ excellent range of metering options as well.  
+ it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen.  
- the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ).  
+ the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use.  it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price.  
+ the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use. i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos ! 	
+ this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it.  
+ seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want.  
+ it is a very amazing product.  i highly recommend it.  
+ i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it.  
- the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens. however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem.  
- the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage. i wish canon would work out some way for that issue. 
- the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy.  
+ i love this camera. i am still trying to figure out the may options it has.  
- [u].maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing.  
- [u].it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got.  
- the grain was terrible. next time i set it at 100 and used the flash.   
- well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise.  
+ when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome.  
+ i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images.  
- the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash.
- relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots.  
+ contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon.  
- now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! 
+ what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware.  
- the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software.  
- what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical. what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it.  
+ i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision.  
+ this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well.  
+ my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time.  
+ manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding. i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck.  
+ the service from the supplier was exceptional. the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition.  
+ by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced.  
- about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder.this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler.  
+ i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
+ the light auto-correction is awesome.  
+ you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right 
- the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds.  
- got way too many blurry pictures. i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 ! 
+ 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , 
+ 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera.  
+ it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features.  
- the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots.  
- it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button.  
- it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot.  
.i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive.  
- unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted.  
+ this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier.  
+ i love the quality of the pictures. they look fantastic.  
+ the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there.  
.i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital.  
+ i love the eos based controls and easy menus. i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera. many before me have done that already.  
- the included lens cap is very loose on the camera.  
.though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself.  
- the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic. the g2 was better in this respect.  
- it had a heavier and more sturdy casing. despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera.  
+ this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! 
+ am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
+ very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera. i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged.  
+ the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom.  
- one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all.  
+ the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use.  
+ because this camera is beautiful. the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely.  
+ the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
+ its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen.  
+ i am very pleased with it so far. i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time.  
- you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder.  
- it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
+ it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop.  
+ it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! 
+ also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage. excellent idea ! 
- one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough.  
+ i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything.  
+ it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera. 
+ it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly.  
+ the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography.  
- the included memory card is too small.  go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense.  
- it is made of plastic.  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience.  
- the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot.  his is not a handbag camera.  
- the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile.  
- the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to.  
- this camera has a major design flaw.  
- when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens.  
+ the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer.  
+ the moveable lcd screen is great.  
- the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera.  
- i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better.  
+ very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price.  
+ the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen.  
- the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots.  
+  there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box.  
-  after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them.
+  my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared.  
+  the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise.  
+  the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers.  
-  the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint.  
-  after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent.  
+  it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! 
-  i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable 
-  the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! 
-  the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly.  
+  on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life.  
-  i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous.  
-  since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours ".  
+  tmobile is trying very hard , and again they do have pretty good csr 's.  
+  i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional.  
+  while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it.  
+  i highly recommend a nokia 6610.  
- the volume level of the phone is not all that good.  
- some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to.  
- the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times.  
- the vibration is not top.  it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in.  
+ overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned.  
- i am bored with the silver look.  
+ it has a nice color screen.  
- radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in.  
+ t-mobile was a pretty good server.  	
- it also does n't have voice activated dialing.  big minus ! ! 
- this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it.  
- when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there.
- negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button.  
- poor visibility on the keys.  
- only con i can think of is no camera. ...  
+ anything this phone does , it does perfectly.  
+ this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone.  
+ you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance.  
+ the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly.  
+ you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly.  
- only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing.  
- the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile.  
+ another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world.  
- ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring.  
- the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out.  
- games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games.  
- buttons do seem a little sticky tho. . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem. . 
+ the reception and sound quality are top-notch.  
. i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service.  
+ i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed.   
- there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient.  
- so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option.  
- other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack.  
- no voice activated dialing
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones.  
+ one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date.  
- the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless.  
- regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop.  
+ the phone is small , light , and very attractive.  
+ the battery life is amazing.  
+ i highly recommend this phone to anyone. i 've yet to be dissappointed.  
- i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough.  
- in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control.  
- one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work.  
- one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible.  
- the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality.  
- one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610.
